<p>Currently I'm working as an electrical engineering co-op at iRobot, helping to advance their mission of building cool stuff and changing the world. Previously I have interned at Riverside Research in the Radar Assessment and Development lab.<br>

<a id="regame-vr-lab" class="anchor" href="#regame-vr-lab" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ReGame-VR Lab</h3>

<p>at Northeastern University in the Department of Physical Therapy. Here I worked on designing an experiment to test the effectiveness of virtual reality rehabilitation games in children with cerebral palsy. Using MATLAB, I integrated the arduino sensor and controls with bluetooth information from a Wii Fit Balance Board.   </p>

<p>I will be posting updates on my personal projects as I work on them. Currently in the design process are:  </p>

<h3>
<a id="desktop-robotic-gardener" class="anchor" href="#desktop-robotic-gardener" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Desktop Robotic Gardener</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a tabletop hydroponic system which can grow plants without any human interaction. The sensors will monitor and be able to adjust water flow, light, temperature and pH levels. I have been awarded a grant through Northeastern University's IDEA Fund to assist with the development costs. </p>

<a id="glove-controls-for-irobots-create-2" class="anchor" href="#glove-controls-for-irobots-create-2" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Glove controls for iRobot's Create 2</h3>

<p>This arduino based controller will connect to a Roomba Create 2 over bluetooth serial controls. The drive controls will be located in a glove the user wears in order to adjust speed and turn. The goal of this project is to build an R2D2 unit on top of the Create 2 and be able to drive it with "the force". </p>

<h3>
<a id="polygraph" class="anchor" href="#polygraph" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Polygraph</h3>

<p>Earlier this year I designed a polygraph as an introduction to biosensors and for a class on deception at Splash for Northeastern University's Program for Teaching by Undergraduates (NEPTUN) with Criminal Justice and Psychology student Alexa Lambros. The polygraph originally consisted of a pulse sensor, a galvanic skin response sensor, and a breathing rate monitor, but the breathing rate monitor was removed because we didn't think it would be a good idea to tie up high school students. The second part of this project was learning to accurately read a polygraph, which I was able to do approximately fifty percent of the time. Since the completion of this project, it has been disassembled so the parts can be reused. </p>

<a id="writing" class="anchor" href="#writing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing</h2>

<p>Outside of engineering, I am passionate about writing.  I am on the third draft of the manuscript of my novel, tentatively named <em>Time Crunch</em>. Updates will be posted as the writing and hopefully, publishing process continue. </p>
