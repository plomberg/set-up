Previously I have interned at Riverside Research in the Radar Assessment and Development lab.   \r\n![iRobot](set-up/logo.png)  \r\n  \r\n![Riverside Research](set-up/RR.png)\r\n\r\n  \r\n## Academic Research  \r\n###ReGame-VR Lab   \r\nat Northeastern University in the Department of Physical Therapy. Here I worked on designing an experiment to test the effectiveness of virtual reality rehabilitation games in children with cerebral palsy. Using MATLAB, I integrated the arduino sensor and controls with bluetooth information from a Wii Fit Balance Board.   \r\n\r\n###Laboratory of Nanotechnology in Civil Engineering (NICE Lab)  \r\nat Northeastern University in the Department of Civil Engineering. I used MATLAB to design a city block, and then \r\n\r\n## Personal Projects\r\nI will be posting updates on my personal projects as I work on them. Currently in the design process are:  \r\n\r\n###Desktop Robotic Gardener  \r\nThe goal of this project is to create a tabletop hydroponic system which can grow plants without any human interaction. The sensors will monitor and be able to adjust water flow, light, temperature and pH levels. I have been awarded a grant through Northeastern University's IDEA Fund to assist with the development costs. \r\n\r\n###Glove controls for iRobot's Create 2  \r\nThis arduino based controller will connect to a Roomba Create 2 over bluetooth serial controls. The drive controls will be located in a glove the user wears in order to adjust speed and turn. The goal of this project is to build an R2D2 unit on top of the Create 2 and be able to drive it with \"the force\". \r\n\r\n###Polygraph  \r\nEarlier this year I designed a polygraph as an introduction to biosensors and for a class on deception at Splash for Northeastern University's Program for Teaching by Undergraduates (NEPTUN) with Criminal Justice and Psychology student Alexa Lambros. The polygraph originally consisted of a pulse sensor, a galvanic skin response sensor, and a breathing rate monitor, but the breathing rate monitor was removed because we didn't think it would be a good idea to tie up high school students. The second part of this project was learning to accurately read a polygraph, which I was able to do approximately fifty percent of the time. Since the completion of this project, it has been disassembled so the parts can be reused. \r\n\r\n## Writing\r\nOutside of engineering, I am passionate about writing.  I am on the third draft of the manuscript of my novel, tentatively named _Time Crunch_. Updates will be posted as the writing and hopefully, publishing process continue. \r\n",
